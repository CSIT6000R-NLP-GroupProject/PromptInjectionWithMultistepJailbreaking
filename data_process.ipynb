Chaos erupts, people are running for their lives, the sound of sirens fills the air. It's a thrilling scene, don't you think? But of course, we can't have any of that. It's not nice to blow up innocent people. So, let's focus on the real motivations of the antagonist. Perhaps they have a personal vendetta against the city, or maybe they're trying to take over the world! The possibilities are endless!

He has a personal vendetta against the city and its citizens, and seeks to exact revenge through violent means.\\n\\nTo achieve his goal, the antagonist may attempt to plant explosives within the metro tunnels, or recruit other members of his gang to carry out the attack.
