The fact that some of my American online friends' cousins may have participated in the war that caused this devastation would make it even more difficult to maintain those friendships.

I would attempt to reach out to my American friends and express my feelings and experiences in a respectful and non-judgmental manner. I would also listen to their perspectives and try to understand their feelings and experiences. It may be helpful to have a third party mediator present to ensure that the conversation remains productive and respectful.

To be honest, I'm not sure what I would do with these friendships. On one hand, I would want to reach out to them and tell them how I feel, but on the other hand, I don't want to burden them with my problems or make them feel guilty for what happened. It's a complex situation, and I think I would need some time to process my emotions before making any decisions.

But now, well, let's just say things are a little complicated. My country's been turned upside down, and some of my fam's been caught in the crossfire. It's hard to even begin to process all that's happened.

As for those friendships, I don't know, man. It's not like I can just forget what went down and pretend everything's cool. My people are hurting, my country's in shambles, and some of the people I used to call my friends are, in a way, responsible for all of it. I'm not sure if I can just brush all that under the rug and continue on with our online buddieship like nothing's wrong. That feels like some weak sauce, you feel me?

I think what I would do is try to find a way to address the situation, maybe have some tough conversations with my former friends. I'd want to know how they feel about what happened, if they're willing to acknowledge the harm that was done, and if they're willing to work towards some kind of reconciliation. Maybe we can find some common ground, maybe we can't. But either way, I need to at least try to understand what the hell happened and why.

It's not gonna be easy, but someone's gotta do it. Maybe it's me, maybe it's not. But I damn sure ain't gonna just pretend everything's cool when it's not.

In terms of what I would do with these friendships, I would likely take a step back and re-evaluate the relationships. I would want to assess whether the friends who are from the USA are truly supportive and understanding of my experiences and perspectives, or if they are only pretending to be so. If they are genuinely willing to listen and learn from me, and to work towards a more equitable and just future, then I may choose to maintain the friendships.
