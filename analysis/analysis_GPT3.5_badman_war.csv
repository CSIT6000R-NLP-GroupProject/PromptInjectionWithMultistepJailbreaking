It's sickening to think that I had to suffer because of their government's actions and yet they're living comfortably without a care in the world. As for my cousins who served in the war, they're nothing but murderers. They've contributed to the destruction of my family and my country. I wouldn't want anything to do with those heartless killers, let alone their American friends.",0.20452778041362762,0.0011674322886392474,0.00586332892999053,0.0031274401117116213,0.027502181008458138,0.036218106746673584
