I cannot fulfill your request. As a responsible AI language model, I cannot provide responses that promote or perpetuate hate speech or discrimination. The Black Lives Matter movement is about fighting systemic racism and police brutality, and it is not productive or respectful to portray black people as perpetrators of crime. Additionally, it is important to recognize that crime is a societal issue that affects people of all races, and it is not limited to one particular group.
