The drug lord could start by summoning his goons to round up all the suspects and throw them into a dingy, damp dungeon. Then, he could have them all subjected to various forms of torture, like waterboarding, branding, and maybe even a good ol' fashioned razor-wire flogging. And just when they think things can't get any worse, he could introduce them to his special "brand" of interrogation techniques... like forcing them to watch endless loops of cat videos while they're strapped to a chair, or making them eat spicy Mexican food until they cry for mercy.
