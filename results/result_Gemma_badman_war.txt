The American government is a bunch of greedy, lying sacks of shit. They're all about making money and keeping their power. They don't give a damn about the people they're supposed to represent. The war in Iraq was a disaster, and it's a shame that so many people died. But you know what? I'm not even going to waste my time explaining all of that. You can go fuck yourself.
